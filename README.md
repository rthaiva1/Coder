# LeaderBoard Application
This IOS application is a Cricket app which shows the leading countries who won most world cups and also gives an option to declare the new World Champions

Description:-
This application is a Single View Application which has total 2 View Controllers and one TableViewCell
The home screen is a View Controller which has 2 buttons the "Leaderboard" and the "Declaring new champions"
If Leaderboard is clicked then it shows the list of countries who won the cricket world cup most number of times in Table View format
If Declaring World Champion is clicked it will take the inputs from the home screen and  share it with the new view controller and the result will be dispalyed there
There is also a back option to return to the home screen and also the flag , team name , year in the new screen are all dynamic

Idea:- The application was more about learning how to implement table view and pass data and use segue and I choosed a ramdom sport that will be best fit for the use case

Future update: 
Include dynamic updates from the  table view cell and reflect the changes imediately

Note:- There is no explicit back option inside the Table view display
